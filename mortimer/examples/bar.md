Bar
===

A rope walks into a bar.

The bartender looks at him and says, "we don't serve ropes here!  Get out!".

The rope, crestfallen, retreats into an alley where he finds a coat and a hat.  

The rope puts on the coat and the hat and walks back into the bar.   The bartender looks at him
and says, "you're that rope, aren't you?  Get out!".

The rope now is very sad, and he wanders back into the alley.  Then, he gets an idea!

He ties himself up and splits his ends, and then walks back into the bar.

The bartender looks at him, looks at him again, and then looks at him a third time.   He says "You're
that rope, aren't you?"

The rope shrugs.  "Nope, I'm a frayed knot."
